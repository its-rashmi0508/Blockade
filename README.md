# Blockade
The objective of this project is to develop a classic Blockade Game using C# in a console-based environment. The game allows the player to navigate a frog to eat randomly placed food items within a specified grid, which increases both the frog’s and the player’s score. The game ends when the frog collides with the boundary walls or itself.
